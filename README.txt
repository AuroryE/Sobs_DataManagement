For my final project, the main goal will be to connect the plot, point, and observation sheets from my SOBS data and create a database for the same, and to clean up any errors and typos, particularly in the species observations and plot IDs. I will also create some summary figures of the data looking at interspecies associations. If that proceeds efficiently, then I will do the same with my jay data. My input will be the raw data csv files from the SOBS surveys and the output will be the cleaned csv files in a new database.

I have chosen to list .xlsx and .docx files in my .gitignore file primarily because the data might get saved as .xlsx files at some point and because I might include paper drafts at some stage.
